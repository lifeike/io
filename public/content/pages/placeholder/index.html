<h1>A placeholder file to keep the directory open between the kit branches</h1>
<h2>content/page</h2>
<p>Any content that's to be used to render a page from a template goes here.</p>
<p>Any directory data (such as the blog files for the CMS) get its own content/ directory.</p>
<p>HTML that's shared between pages has a layout created in _includes/layouts.</p>
<p>Files created in the content/ directory must have the following frontmatter - note the eleventyNavigation object is optional, only needed if you want the page to appear in the header/footer navs:</p>
<p>A content.json file has been created to automatically tag any content/ file with a &quot;sitemap&quot; tag. If the optimization branch is used, the sitemap collection is used to generate a sitemap.xml file</p>
<hr>
<p>title: &quot;Page title that's used directly in the <title> tag&quot;
description: &quot;A short, 2-3 line description for use in SERPs and OG tags&quot;
permalink: 'slug-name-with-slash-AFTER/'
eleventyNavigation:
key: 'Name for the navigation'
order: 'Lowest number comes first'
parent: 'Supply another pages key here to create a dropdown (if using a CodeStitch dropdown navigation)'</p>
